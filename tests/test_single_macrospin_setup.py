=========================================================================
Single Macrospin Setup Tests
=========================================================================

Tests for the setup of a single macrospin

A single macrospin is required. It is neccessary to specify the following
parameters associated with it:

- The coordinate where it is located in space (assuming cartesian)
- Saturation Magnetisation, Ms
- alpha
- gamma
- The Zeeman field
- initial magnetisation direction, m
- time, t

The following tests check the assignment of these variables.
